# Grocery-Management-System-
This project is a simple Python-based Grocery Management System designed to help shopkeepers manage their store digitally. The application uses a menu-driven interface so that even a non-technical user can easily navigate through different operations. All the information, such as products, stock levels, and sales details, is stored in JSON files, making the system lightweight and easy to maintain without requiring a database.

The system allows the shopkeeper to manage products by adding new items, updating existing ones, deleting products, and viewing the complete product list. Every change in product details is immediately stored into the JSON file to ensure data accuracy. When generating bills, the system automatically calculates the total amount, quantity, and applicable taxes. After a successful purchase, the stock is updated automatically, and the sale is recorded for future reference.

Along with billing, the system also handles profit, revenue, and tax calculations. Each sale contributes to daily financial data, which helps the shopkeeper understand business performance. The application can generate different reports such as sales reports, stock summaries, profit details, and tax summaries using the data stored in JSON files.

Running the system is simple. After installing Python, the user just needs to keep the script and JSON files in the same folder and run the program. The system loads all available data, executes the chosen operations, updates stock and sales information, and finally saves everything back to JSON before safely exiting. The structure of the project remains straightforward, using functions for different modules and file handling for data management.

Future enhancements may include adding a graphical user interface, generating PDF invoices, integrating barcode scanning, or implementing a login system for admin and staff roles. Overall, this project provides a basic but effective way to digitize a grocery shop with minimal setup and easy-to-use operations.
